# OpenCV and TensorFlow-lite model for face and hand detection

## Face detection
OpenCV-python code for face-detection where the input can be taken from image as well as from webcam. Also storing the detected face is also supported.

## Hand detection
Opencv-python code for hande detection. Here input is single image as well video from webcam.

## tflite

mesh.py code for generating point cloud for the given cordinates.   
tflite.py is a code for hand-detection using lightweight TensorFlow model which can easily be use for any apk.
